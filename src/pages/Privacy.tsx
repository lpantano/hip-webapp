                We started this project because we care about data and science integrity, transparency, and making that information available for people. We value data privacy as much as this project and consider protecting your data an absolute must.

You do not have to provide things like your real name, address, or date of birth to sign up for a regular user account. For expert and researcher accounts that create content with their knowledge/expertise, we do require personal information to validate their credentials—that's fundamental to keeping this project integral.
